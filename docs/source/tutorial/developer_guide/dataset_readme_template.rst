Template of a dataset README.rst file
=====================================

When creating a dataset, its good idea to provide a small documentation of the structure and information of the data.

When creating such documentation, it is good practice to follow a common format to keep things similar.

The following scheme details a template format on how to write the documentation of a new dataset and what information to provide to the end user.
