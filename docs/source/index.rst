========================================
Welcome to dbcollection's documentation!
========================================

``dbcollection`` is a library for downloading/parsing/managing datasets via simple methods.
It was built from the ground up to be *cross-platform* (**Windows**, **Linux**, **MacOS**) and
*cross-language* (**Python**, **Lua**, **Matlab**, **etc.**). This is achieved by using the popular ``HDF5`` file format
to store (meta)data of manually parsed datasets and the power of **Python** for scripting. By doing so, this library can target
any platform that supports **Python** and any language that has bindings for ``HDF5``.


This library contains a (growing!) list of popular datasets in computer science for many fields like **object detection**,
**classification**, **human body joint detection**, **captioning**, etc. It provides a great way to quickly start hacking on
a number of different tasks by skipping the boring task of learning how to set/parse datasets (and sometimes dealing with human errors in annotated data).


Also, since it has been developed with community in mind,
this library should encourage users to write and share their scripts for downloading/parsing other datasets with the community.

The project's code is publicly available on `GitHub <https://github.com/dbcollection/dbcollection>`_
and is licensed under the :ref:`MIT license <license>`.


Main features
=============

- Simple API to load/download/setup/manage datasets.
- Simple API to fetch data from a dataset.
- Store and pull data from disk or from memory, you choose!
- Datasets only need to be set/processed once, so next time you use it it will load instantly!
- Cross-platform (**Windows**, **Linux**, **MacOs**).
- Cross-language (**Python**, **Lua/Torch7**, **Matlab**).
- Easily extensible to other languages that support `HDF5` files format.
- Concurrent/parallel data access thanks to `HDF5`.
- Contains a diverse (and growing!) list of popular datasets for machine-, deep-learning tasks (*object detection*, *action recognition*, *human pose estimation*, etc.)
