This project wants to have its presence on more channels than on GitHub but, for now, we only use the GitHub repo page for assistance.

    This project wants to have its presence on more channels than on GitHub.
    We want to be responsive and at the same time be effective, for example, we want
    to avoid having to provide the same answer on different channels.
    This page describes how this project intends to clarify its users on the different channels.


`Github issues <https://github.com/dbcollection/dbcollection/issues>`_
======================================================================

`Github issues <https://github.com/dbcollection/dbcollection/issues>`_  should be used for bugs
and feature requests. How to submit good bugs and feature requests is described in
:ref:`How to Contribute <how_to_contribute>`.

.. note::

    We don't want to use Github Issues for general 'how-to' questions about dbcollection.
    Instead, these general 'how-to' questions may/will be redirected to Stack Overflow.

..
    `Stack Overflow <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/dbcollection>`_
    ===========================================================================

    `Stack overflow <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/dbcollection>`_  is one of
    the best places for getting high quality answers. Stack overflow questions without an answer are
    tracked periodically, so they shouldn't go unanswered for a long time.
